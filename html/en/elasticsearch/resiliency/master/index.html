Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene to protect your data.  As with any distributed
system, Elasticsearch is complex and has many moving parts, each of which can
encounter edge cases that require proper handling.  Our resiliency project is
an ongoing effort to find and fix these edge cases. If you want to keep up
with all this project on GitHub, see our issues list under the tag
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues?q=label%3Aresiliency" target="_top">resiliency</a>.</p><p>While GitHub is great for sharing our work, it can be difficult to get an
overview of the current state of affairs and the previous work that has been
done from an issues list. This page provides an overview of all the
resiliency-related issues that we are aware of, improvements that have already
been made and current in-progress work. We’ve also listed some historical
improvements throughout this page to provide the full context.</p><p>If you’re interested in more on how we approach ensuring resiliency in
Elasticsearch, you may be interested in Igor Motov’s recent talk
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/videos/improving-elasticsearch-resiliency/" target="_top">Improving Elasticsearch Resiliency</a>.</p><p>You may also be interested in our blog post
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/resiliency-elasticsearch/" target="_top">Resiliency in Elasticsearch</a>,
which details our thought processes when addressing resiliency in both
Elasticsearch and the work our developers do upstream in Apache Lucene.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="_data_store_recommendations"></a>Data Store Recommendations<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h1></div></div></div><p>Some customers use Elasticsearch as a primary datastore, some set-up
comprehensive back-up solutions using features such as our Snapshot and
Restore, while others use Elasticsearch in conjunction with a data storage
system like Hadoop or even flat files. Elasticsearch can be used for so many
different use cases which is why we have created this page to make sure you
are fully informed when you are architecting your system.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="_work_in_progress"></a>Work in Progress<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h1></div></div></div><h3><a id="_known_unknowns_status_ongoing"></a>Known Unknowns (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>We consider this topic to be the most important in our quest for
resiliency. We put a tremendous amount of effort into testing
Elasticsearch to simulate failures and randomize configuration to
produce extreme conditions. In addition, our users are an important
source of information on unexpected edge cases and your bug reports
help us make fixes that ensure that our system continues to be
resilient.</p><p>If you encounter an issue, <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues" target="_top">please report it</a>!</p><p>We are committed to tracking down and fixing all the issues that are posted.</p><h3><a id="_better_request_retry_mechanism_when_nodes_are_disconnected_status_ongoing"></a>Better request retry mechanism when nodes are disconnected (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>If the node holding a primary shard is disconnected for whatever reason, the
coordinating node retries the request on the same or a new primary shard.  In
certain rare conditions, where the node disconnects and immediately
reconnects, it is possible that the original request has already been
successfully applied but has not been reported, resulting in duplicate
requests. This is particularly true when retrying bulk requests, where some
actions may  have completed and some may not have.</p><p>An optimization which disabled the existence check for documents indexed with
auto-generated IDs could result in the creation of duplicate documents. This
optimization has been removed. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9468" target="_top">#9468</a> (STATUS: DONE, v1.5.0)</p><p>Further issues remain with the retry mechanism:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

data-only nodes.  This is not a problem when running with multiple master nodes,
as recommended, as the loss of all but one master node is still recoverable.
However, users running with a single master node are at risk of losing
their index metadata if the master fails.  Instead, this metadata should
also be written on any node where a shard is allocated. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/8823" target="_top">#8823</a></p><h3><a id="_better_file_distribution_with_multiple_data_paths_status_ongoing"></a>Better file distribution with multiple data paths (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Today, a node configured with multiple data paths distributes writes across
all paths by writing one file to each path in turn.  This can mean that the
failure of a single disk corrupts many shards at once.  Instead, by allocating
an entire shard to a single data path, the extent of the damage can be limited
to just the shards on that disk. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9498" target="_top">#9498</a></p><h3><a id="_oom_resiliency_status_ongoing"></a>OOM resiliency (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>The family of circuit breakers has greatly reduced the occurrence of OOM
exceptions, but it is still possible to cause a node to run out of heap
space.  The following issues have been identified:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

field can be added to different shards with different data types.  Each shard
will operate with its local data type but, if the shard is relocated, the
data type from the cluster state will be applied to the new shard, which
can result in a corrupt shard.  To prevent this, new fields should not
be added to a shard’s mapping until confirmed by the master.
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/8688" target="_top">#8688</a> (STATUS: ONGOING)</p><h3><a id="_loss_of_documents_during_network_partition_status_ongoing"></a>Loss of documents during network partition (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>If a network partition separates a node from the master, there is some window of time before the node detects it. The length of the window is dependent on the type of the partition. This window is extremely small if a socket is broken. More adversarial partitions, for example, silently dropping requests without breaking the socket can take longer (up to 3x30s using current defaults).</p><p>If the node hosts a primary shard at the moment of partition, and ends up being isolated from the cluster (which could have resulted in <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2488" target="_top">split-brain</a> before), some documents that are being indexed into the primary may be lost if they fail to reach one of the allocated replicas (due to the partition) and that replica is later promoted to primary by the master. <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/7572" target="_top">#7572</a></p><p>A test to replicate this condition was added in <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/7493" target="_top">#7493</a>.</p><h3><a id="_prevent_use_of_known_bad_java_versions_status_ongoing"></a>Prevent use of known-bad Java versions (STATUS: ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Certain versions of the JVM are known to have bugs which can cause index corruption.  <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/7580" target="_top">#7580</a> prevents Elasticsearch startup if known bad versions are in use.</p><h3><a id="_lucene_checksums_phase_3_status_ongoing"></a>Lucene checksums phase 3 (STATUS:ONGOING)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Almost all files in Elasticsearch now have checksums which are validated before use.

We traced the source of the problem to the fact that when serializing documents to the transaction log, the Operating System can actually write only part of the document before returning from the write call. We can now detect this situation and make sure that the entire document is properly written. You can read the full details in pull request <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/6576" target="_top">#6576</a>.</p><h3><a id="_lucene_checksums_status_done_v1_2_0"></a>Lucene Checksums (STATUS: DONE, v1.2.0)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Before Apache Lucene version 4.8, checksums were not computed on generated index files. The result was that it was difficult to identify when or if a Lucene index got corrupted, whether by hardware failure, JVM bug or for an entirely different reason.</p><p>For an idea of the checksum efforts in progress in Apache Lucene, see issues <a class="ulink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2446" target="_top">LUCENE-2446</a>, <a class="ulink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5580" target="_top">LUCENE-5580</a> and <a class="ulink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5602" target="_top">LUCENE-5602</a>. The gist is that Lucene 4.8+ now computes full checksums on all index files and it verifies them when opening metadata or other smaller files as well as other files during merges.</p><h3><a id="_detect_errors_faster_by_locally_failing_a_shard_upon_an_indexing_error_status_done_v1_2_0"></a>Detect errors faster by locally failing a shard upon an indexing error (STATUS: DONE, v1.2.0)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Previously, Elasticsearch notified the master of the shard failure and waited for the master to close the local copy of the shard, thus assigning it to other nodes. This architecture caused delays in failure detection, potentially causing unneeded failures of other incoming requests. In rare cases, such as concurrency racing conditions or certain network partitions configurations, we could lose these failure notifications. We solved this issue by locally failing shards upon indexing errors. See issue <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/5847" target="_top">#5847</a>.</p><h3><a id="_snapshot_restore_api_status_done_v1_0_0"></a>Snapshot/Restore API (STATUS: DONE, v1.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>In Elasticsearch version 1.0, we significantly improved the backup process by introducing the Snapshot/Restore API. While it was always possible to make backups of Elasticsearch, the Snapshot/Restore API made the backup process much easier.</p><p>The backup process is incremental, making it very efficient since only files changed since the last backup are copied. Even with this efficiency introduced, each snapshot contains a full picture of the cluster at the moment when backup started. The restore API allows speedy recovery of a full cluster as well as selected indices.</p><p>Since that first release in version 1.0, the API has continued to evolve. In version 1.1.0, we added a new snapshot status API that allows users to monitor the snapshot process. In 1.3.0 we added the ability to <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/6457" target="_top">restore indices without their aliases</a> and in 1.4 we are planning to add the ability to <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/6368" target="_top">restore partial snapshots</a>.</p><p>The Snapshot/Restore API supports a number of different repository types for storing backups. Currently, it’s possible to make backups to a shared file system, Amazon S3, HDFS, and Azure storage. We are continuing to work on adding other types of storage systems, as well as improving the robustness of the snapshot/restore process.</p><h3><a id="_circuit_breaker_fielddata_status_done_v1_0_0"></a>Circuit Breaker: Fielddata (STATUS: DONE, v1.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Currently, the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-fielddata.html" target="_top">circuit breaker</a> protects against loading too much field data by estimating how much memory the field data will take to load, then aborting the request if the memory requirements are too high. This feature was added in Elasticsearch version 1.0.0.</p><h3><a id="_use_of_paginated_data_structures_to_ease_garbage_collection_status_done_v1_0_0_amp_v1_2_0"></a>Use of Paginated Data Structures to Ease Garbage Collection (STATUS: DONE, v1.0.0 &amp; v1.2.0)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Elasticsearch has moved from an object-based cache to a page-based cache recycler as described in issue <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/4557" target="_top">#4557</a>. This change makes garbage collection easier by limiting fragmentation, since all pages have the same size and are recycled. It also allows managing the size of the cache not based on the number of objects it contains, but on the memory that it uses.</p><p>These pages are used for two main purposes: implementing higher level data structures such as hash tables that are used internally by aggregations to eg. map terms to counts, as well as reusing memory in the translog/transport layer as detailed in issue <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/5691" target="_top">#5691</a>.</p><h3><a id="_dedicated_master_nodes_resiliency_status_done_v1_0_0"></a>Dedicated Master Nodes Resiliency (STATUS: DONE, v1.0.0)<a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>In order to run a more resilient cluster, we recommend running dedicated master nodes to ensure master nodes are not affected by resources consumed by data nodes. We also have made master nodes more resilient to heavy resource usage, mainly associated with large clusters / cluster states.</p><p>These changes include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

Randomized testing allows us to easily enhance the Elasticsearch testing infrastructure with predictably irrational conditions, making the resulting code base more resilient.</p><p>Each of our integration tests runs against a cluster with a random number of nodes, and indices have a random number of shards and replicas. Merge settings change for every run, indexing is done in serial or async fashion or even wrapped in a bulk operation and thread pool sizes vary to ensure that we don’t produce a deadlock no matter what happens. The list of places we use this randomization infrastructure is long, and growing every day, and has saved us headaches several times before we shipped a particular feature.</p><p>At Elasticsearch, we live the philosophy that we can miss a bug once, but never a second time. We make our tests more evil as you go, introducing randomness in all the areas where we discovered bugs. We figure if our tests don’t fail, weare not trying hard enough!
